## About the Project

Car Hub is a web based application designed to predict the price of a car based upon the provided dataset. It is build to handle and visualise the data for an automotive industry. 
I am a complete beginner in data analysis but thanks to kaggle. I have trained a model and pickled it to use it with outputs entered by the user.

## Built with

**Front-end:** HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap

**Server:** Django Framework

**Data Analysis:** Python



## Features

- Asks for 10 inputs from the user.

- Predicts the estimated price.

- User can view the dataset.




## Start Building the Project

### Requirements 
- VS Code or any IDE you are comfortable with.
- Python should be installed.
- Django should be installed.

### Setting up the project
- Create a folder on the desktop.
- Open the VS Code in the terminal.
- Set up a Django project using the terminal
```bash
  django-admin startproject carhub
```
- Open the carhub folder in vs code. The folder should contain a carhub folder and a manage.py file.
- Install Django in this carhub folder.
```bash
  pip install django
```
- Further create django app using
```bash
  python manage.py startapp home
```
- Also create the templates folder and the static folder for your templates and static files and you are good to go.
- Create a folder by the name of data analysis to add the dataset and the data analysis file to run the code.
- The folder structure should like this and you are good to go.

- It would be a good practice to first do the analysis part on a notebook like google colab etc.
